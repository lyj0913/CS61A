Project Discription:
In this project, you will create a Typing Test, which will allow users to measure their typing speed. 
Additionally, you will implement autocorrect, which is a feature that attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. 
This project is inspired by Type Racer. The exciting part of this project is that the amount of code provided to you is very minimal,
so by the end you'll have constructed almost an entire program by yourself!
